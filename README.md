<big>**Initial Plugin Setup**</big><br>
CrazyCrates as first install will come with a set of default files in the `crates` folder which are to help you figure out how to use the plugin.
You can simply create more crates by copying the files or creating new ones than doing `/crazycrates reload`<br>
Testing your crates is even easier, if you simply want to test prizes. We have a command for that called `/crazycrates debug <crate>`
